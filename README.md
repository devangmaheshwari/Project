VIDEO STREAMING - DATABASE PROJECT

To effectively manage data for a Video Streaming Platform, a database schema has been designed to implement. The schema includes tables to store information about the movies available on the platform, including their titles, genres, and actors starring in them.

The system stores user information, including login credentials and watch progress. As users can have multiple profiles in their accounts, a table stores user profile information.

To provide personalized recommendations to users, the system stores movie ratings by users.

Overall, the database schemahas been designed to effectively manage and store all necessary data for the Video Streaming Platform, allowing for efficient and seamless user experiences.
